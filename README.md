# GeoSnap
A sample multi-page website project for my portfolio.

*Warning!*
Due to a huge mess in CSS design the page may not display correctly in different zoom settings or resolutions. (Default workspace settings: 100%, 15.6", 1920x1080)
The nav menu elements appear faulty and move when hovered.

Feedback to self:
- Study Responsive Web Design
- Find ways to implement JS in future projects
- Use more sophisticated CSS animations
- Make a nav menu with buttons that don't move (!)
- Learn more about tables
- Pay attention to code clarity
